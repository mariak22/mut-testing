Change is inevitable, therefore itâ€™s very rare that you would write some piece of code and never touch it again. As the requirements change, so will your code. Testing your software is a great way of knowing whether or not your code behaves as expected. But tests are also written by people and people make mistakes.

The goal of this project will be to introduce a mutation testing framework which automatically embed mutations and run all our tests for us. It also provides a detailed analysis of the results, including the amount of mutations, percentage of killed mutations in the form of a mutation score.
